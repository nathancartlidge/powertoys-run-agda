# Agda (/Latex) input for Powertoys Run

A PowerToys Run plugin that allows you to type `\==` and get out the unicode symbol `â‰¡` - potentially one of the fastest ways to get at these characters if you've learnt the shortcuts for them!

> This is still under active development - while it does technically work in its current form, expect significant issues! Once stable releases are available they will be tagged and published
