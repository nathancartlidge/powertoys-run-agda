## Introduction
**TLDR:** this plugin lets you type `\ne` and get `â‰ ` in your clipboard, or thousands of other combinations!

> Do you often need to type unicode symbols like `â„¢` or `â‰¤`? Do you have the wikipedia page for
> [box drawing characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character#Unicode) saved as a bookmark? Have you
> ever tried to write digital notes about Agda outside of Emacs? This might just be the plugin for you!

**Agda-Input** is a [PowerToys Run](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/powertoys/run) plugin that emulates the input
capabilities of Emacs in [agda-mode](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.4.3/tools/emacs-mode.html#unicode-input).

If you are unfamiliar, this input method allows you to type the Latex form of (almost) any character - this will then be
replaced with the equivalent unicode character in your document, allowing for very the construction of very dense
programs!

For example, you can type `\lambda` and the plugin will insert `Î»` into your document. For longer latex strings, such as
`\mathbb{N}`, you can type `\bN` - this will result in inserting `â„•` into your document.

This plugin is based upon a complete export of Agda's input mappings - as such, any command that works in agda should
also work here!

## Development / Contributing
- This project is based upon dotnet version 8.0.x - to work on it, you will likely want a similar configuration.
- You may wish to update the libraries in `src/libs` with copies from your own machine - these can be found in the root
  directory of your PowerToys installation.
